The word genocide was later included as a descriptive term to the process of indictment , but not yet as a formal legal term According to Lemming , genocide was defined as `` a coordinated strategy to destroy a group of people , a process that could be accomplished through total annihilation as well as strategies that eliminate key elements of the group 's basic existence , including language , culture , and economic infrastructure. ” He created a concept of mobilizing much of the international relations and community , to working together and preventing the occurrence of such events happening within history and the international society .

The exclusion of social and political groups as targets of genocide in the CPPCG legal definition has been criticized by some historians and sociologists , for example M. Hassan Kakar in his book The Soviet Invasion and the Afghan Response , 1979–1982 argues that the international definition of genocide is too restricted , and that it should include political groups or any group so defined by the perpetrator and quotes Chalk and Jonassohn : `` Genocide is a form of one-sided mass killing in which a state or other authority intends to destroy a group , as that group and membership in it are defined by the perpetrator .

Temperley says that in his works `` novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary appoggiaturas or passing notes with melodic figures of accompaniment '' , and cadences are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ( neapolitan sixths and diminished sevenths ) , or by sudden shifts to remote keys .

Some Mainland Chinese scholars , such as Wang Jiawei and Nyima Gyaincain , assert that the Ming dynasty had unquestioned sovereignty over Tibet , pointing to the Ming court 's issuing of various titles to Tibetan leaders , Tibetans ' full acceptance of these titles , and a renewal process for successors of these titles that involved traveling to the Ming capital .

But most scholars outside China , such as Turrell V. Wylie , Melvin C.

The ownership of the Spectre organisation—originally stylised `` SPECTRE '' as an acronym of SPecial Executive for Counter-intelligence , Terrorism , Revenge and Extortion—and its characters , had been at the centre of long-standing litigation starting in 1961 between Ian Fleming and Kevin McClory over the film rights to the novel Thunderball .

The dispute began after Fleming incorporated elements of an undeveloped film script written by McClory and screenwriter Jack Whittingham—including characters and plot points—into Thunderball , which McClory contested in court , claiming ownership over elements of the novel .

As a result of the magnitude 7.9 earthquake and the many strong aftershocks , many rivers became blocked by large landslides , which resulted in the formation of `` quake lakes '' behind the blockages ; these massive amounts of water were pooling up at a very high rate behind the natural landslide dams and it was feared that the blockages would eventually crumble under the weight of the ever-increasing water mass , potentially endangering the lives of millions of people living downstream .

The traditional New York area accent is characterized as non-rhotic , so that the sound [ ɹ ] does not appear at the end of a syllable or immediately before a consonant ; hence the pronunciation of the city name as `` New Yawk . ''

This would often be misperceived by speakers of other accents as a reversal of the er and oy sounds , so that girl is pronounced `` goil '' and oil is pronounced `` erl '' ; this leads to the caricature of New Yorkers saying things like `` Joizey '' ( Jersey ) , `` Toidy-Toid Street '' ( 33rd St. ) and `` terlet '' ( toilet ) .

West 's fourth studio album , 808s & Heartbreak ( 2008 ) , marked an even more radical departure from his previous releases , largely abandoning rap and hip hop stylings in favor of a stark electropop sound composed of virtual synthesis , the Roland TR-808 drum machine , and explicitly auto-tuned vocal tracks .

For Nagarjuna , it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of ātman ; all phenomena ( dharmas ) are without any svabhava ( literally `` own-nature '' or `` self-nature '' ) , and thus without any underlying essence ; they are `` empty '' of being independent ; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism .

Theories given for the success of Southerners on Idol have been : more versatility with musical genres , as the Southern U.S. is home to several music genre scenes ; not having as many opportunities to break into the pop music business ; text-voting due to the South having the highest percentage of cell-phone only households ; and the strong heritage of music and singing , which is notable in the Bible Belt , where it is in church that many people get their start in public singing .

Rather than teach small parts of a large number of subjects , Whitehead advocated teaching a relatively few important concepts that the student could organically link to many different areas of knowledge , discovering their application in actual life .

For Whitehead , education should be the exact opposite of the multidisciplinary , value-free school model – it should be transdisciplinary , and laden with values and general principles that provide students with a bedrock of wisdom and help them to make connections between areas of knowledge that are usually regarded as separate .

In Whitehead 's view , scientists and philosophers make metaphysical assumptions about how the universe works all the time , but such assumptions are not easily seen precisely because they remain unexamined and unquestioned .

While Whitehead acknowledged that `` philosophers can never hope finally to formulate these metaphysical first principles , '' he argued that people need to continually re-imagine their basic assumptions about how the universe works if philosophy and science are to make any real progress , even if that progress remains permanently asymptotic .

Perhaps foremost among what Whitehead considered faulty metaphysical assumptions was the Cartesian idea that reality is fundamentally constructed of bits of matter that exist totally independently of one another , which he rejected in favor of an event-based or `` process '' ontology in which events are primary and are fundamentally interrelated and dependent on one another .

To put it another way , a thing or person is often seen as having a `` defining essence '' or a `` core identity '' that is unchanging , and describes what the thing or person really is .

After all , each moment of each person 's life can hardly be given a different proper name , and it is easy and convenient to think of people and objects as remaining fundamentally the same things , rather than constantly keeping in mind that each thing is a different thing from what it was a moment ago .

No one questions that a ten-year-old person is quite different by the time he or she turns thirty years old , and in many ways is not the same person at all ; Whitehead points out that it is not philosophically or ontologically sound to think that a person is the same from one second to the next .

In higher organisms ( like people ) , these two modes of perception combine into what Whitehead terms `` symbolic reference '' , which links appearance with causation in a process that is so automatic that both people and animals have difficulty refraining from it .

In this way symbolic reference is a fusion of pure sense perceptions on the one hand and causal relations on the other , and that it is in fact the causal relationships that dominate the more basic mentality ( as the dog illustrates ) , while it is the sense perceptions which indicate a higher grade mentality ( as the artist illustrates ) .

The Human Development Index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called `` Western models of development '' , failure to include any ecological considerations , lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization , focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking , lack of attention to development from a global perspective , measurement error of the underlying statistics , and on the UNDP 's changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of 'low ' , 'medium ' , 'high ' or 'very high ' human development countries .

The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because - they claim - the cut-off values seem arbitrary , can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics , and have the potential to misguide politicians , investors , charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large .

After a series of test transmissions and special broadcasts that began in August , regular BBC television broadcasts officially resumed on 1 October 1936 , from a converted wing of Alexandra Palace in London , which housed two studios , various scenery stores , make-up areas , dressing rooms , offices , and the transmitter itself , now broadcasting on the VHF band .

The term heresy is also used as an ideological pigeonhole for contemporary writers because , by definition , heresy depends on contrasts with an established orthodoxy .

For example , the tongue-in-cheek contemporary usage of heresy , such as to categorize a `` Wall Street heresy '' a `` Democratic heresy '' or a `` Republican heresy , '' are metaphors that invariably retain a subtext that links orthodoxies in geology or biology or any other field to religion .
