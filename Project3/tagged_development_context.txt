Westinghouse convinced Tesla to release his company from the licensing agreement over Tesla 's AC patents in exchange for Westinghouse Electric purchasing the patents for a lump sum payment of $ 216,000 ; this provided Westinghouse a break from what , due to alternating current 's rapid gain in popularity , had turned out to be an overly generous $ 2.50 per AC horsepower royalty .

Tesla was incorrect in his assumption that high frequency radio waves would penetrate water but Émile Girardeau , who helped develop France 's first radar system in the 1930s , noted in 1953 that Tesla 's general speculation that a very strong high frequency signal would be needed was correct stating `` ( Tesla ) was prophesying or dreaming , since he had at his disposal no means of carrying them out , but one must add that if he was dreaming , at least he was dreaming correctly .

Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different , the worst-case time complexity T ( n ) is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size n.

If a problem X is in C and hard for C , then X is said to be complete for C. This means that X is the hardest problem in C. ( Since many problems could be equally hard , one might say that X is one of the hardest problems in C. ) Thus the class of NP-complete problems contains the most difficult problems in NP , in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P.

These positions include : the honoured but informal position of starets or elder - a man ( or , less often , woman ) , often a monastic , considered to be graced by God with certain gifts for the guidance of souls and the detection and correction of prelest ( spiritual pride or deception ) - who acts as a spiritual guide or father in the Orthodox Catholic tradition , especially Russian Orthodoxy ( see Optina Monastery , which had a long line of said starets ) ; the Priest or Confessor in Roman Catholicism , who is often a man in Holy Orders but may be a monastic or other person respected for his spiritual accomplishments or acumen ( even the Pope of Rome has a Confessor , who is not always a bishop , and , due to the hierarchical structure of the Roman Church , can not be his equal in authority ) , which is often a semi-official to official position , as opposed to the unofficial positions of spiritual guides in the Orthodox Catholic and Protestant traditions ; and the almost-exclusively informal arrangements ( generally formal only in members who are under some form of church discipline ) of mentorship ( both of adults and children , in the latter case often a youth pastor ) in the Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions , which boundaries can be blurred with the more typically Roman `` confessor '' position in some of the more historic and conservative Reformation Churches , such as some of the Lutheran and Anglican .

Francis Blackburne in 1765 argued that John Jortin misread this and other passages from Luther , while Gottfried Fritschel pointed out in 1867 that it actually refers to the soul of a man `` in this life '' ( homo enim in hac vita ) tired from his daily labour ( defatigus diurno labore ) who at night enters his bedchamber ( sub noctem intrat in cubiculum suum ) and whose sleep is interrupted by dreams .

The nickname may have been a combined reference to the Swiss politician Besançon Hugues ( died 1532 ) and the religiously conflicted nature of Swiss republicanism in his time , using a clever derogatory pun on the name Hugues by way of the Dutch word Huisgenoten ( literally housemates ) , referring to the connotations of a somewhat related word in German Eidgenosse ( Confederates as in `` a citizen of one of the states of the Swiss Confederacy '' ) .

However , as one and the same valve usually controls both steam flows , a short cutoff at admission adversely affects the exhaust and compression periods which should ideally always be kept fairly constant ; if the exhaust event is too brief , the totality of the exhaust steam can not evacuate the cylinder , choking it and giving excessive compression ( `` kick back '' ) .

Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis , and have three main components : a domed head with vesicles ( chambers ) that contain adhesive ; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea ; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk .

A series of studies that looked at the presence and absence of members of gene families and signalling pathways ( e.g. , homeoboxes , nuclear receptors , the Wnt signaling pathway , and sodium channels ) showed evidence congruent with the latter two scenarios , that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria , Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla .

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host .

This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas , which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation , resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site , infecting the host .

The plague theory was first significantly challenged by the work of British bacteriologist J. F. D. Shrewsbury in 1970 , who noted that the reported rates of mortality in rural areas during the 14th-century pandemic were inconsistent with the modern bubonic plague , leading him to conclude that contemporary accounts were exaggerations .

In addition to arguing that the rat population was insufficient to account for a bubonic plague pandemic , sceptics of the bubonic plague theory point out that the symptoms of the Black Death are not unique ( and arguably in some accounts may differ from bubonic plague ) ; that transference via fleas in goods was likely to be of marginal significance ; and that the DNA results may be flawed and might not have been repeated elsewhere , despite extensive samples from other mass graves .

Other arguments include the lack of accounts of the death of rats before outbreaks of plague between the 14th and 17th centuries ; temperatures that are too cold in northern Europe for the survival of fleas ; that , despite primitive transport systems , the spread of the Black Death was much faster than that of modern bubonic plague ; that mortality rates of the Black Death appear to be very high ; that , while modern bubonic plague is largely endemic as a rural disease , the Black Death indiscriminately struck urban and rural areas ; and that the pattern of the Black Death , with major outbreaks in the same areas separated by 5 to 15 years , differs from modern bubonic plague—which often becomes endemic for decades with annual flare-ups .

Archaeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval waterfront in London and that the plague spread too quickly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats ; he argues that transmission must have been person to person .

In addition to the bubonic infection , others point to additional septicemic ( a type of `` blood poisoning '' ) and pneumonic ( an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body ) forms of the plague , which lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms .

However , ABC made a name for itself by utilizing the practice of counterprogramming , with which it often placed shows of its own against the offerings of NBC and CBS , adopting the use of the Magnetophon tape recorder , brought to the U.S. from Nazi Germany after its conquest , to pre-record its programming .

Still , ABC 's limited reach would continue to hobble it for the next two decades ; several smaller markets would not grow large enough to support a full-time ABC affiliate until the 1960s , with some very small markets having to wait as late as the 1980s or even the advent of digital television in the 2000s , which allowed stations like WTRF-TV in Wheeling , West Virginia to begin airing ABC programming on a digital subchannel after airing the network 's programs outside of recommended timeslots decades before .

[ not in citation given ] It should be noted here however that in certain cases , with great economic inequality , there is nonetheless not more waste and pollution created as the waste/pollution is cleaned up better afterwards ( water treatment , filtering , ... ) ... .

The phrase `` Hiding behind ( or 'watching from behind ' ) the sofa '' entered British pop culture , signifying in humour the stereotypical early-series behaviour of children who wanted to avoid seeing frightening parts of a television programme while remaining in the room to watch the remainder of it .

A BBC audience research survey conducted in 1972 found that , by their own definition of violence ( `` any act [ s ] which may cause physical and/or psychological injury , hurt or death to persons , animals or property , whether intentional or accidental '' ) Doctor Who was the most violent of the drama programmes the corporation produced at the time .

Responding to the findings of the survey in The Times newspaper , journalist Philip Howard maintained that , `` to compare the violence of Dr Who , sired by a horse-laugh out of a nightmare , with the more realistic violence of other television series , where actors who look like human beings bleed paint that looks like blood , is like comparing Monopoly with the property market in London : both are fantasies , but one is meant to be taken seriously .

The historian Frederick W. Mote wrote that the usage of the term `` social classes '' for this system was misleading and that the position of people within the four-class system was not an indication of their actual social power and wealth , but just entailed `` degrees of privilege '' to which they were entitled institutionally and legally , so a person 's standing within the classes was not a guarantee of their standing , since there were rich and well socially standing Chinese while there were less rich Mongol and Semu than there were Mongol and Semu who lived in poverty and were ill treated .
